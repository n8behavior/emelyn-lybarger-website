aboutDescription: >
    <p>My coaching is holistic, using emotional intelligence and mindfulness with mind-body methodologies. Together, you and I work with your thinking, emotional, and physical self, and the ways they inform each other, as I support you to achieve your goals. These combined methods help create the sustainable change so many people want, but often have difficulty obtaining. What’s that about, anyway? I can help you explore that, as well!</p>
    <p>What's my background? I have an M.A. in Intercultural Communications from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. I’m a certified Somatic Coach from the Strozzi Institute and a certified Internal Conflict Coach from Pamela J. Green Solutions. I began providing life and leadership coaching to clients in 2012, and began working in team development in 2016. Want to learn more? Get in touch!</p>
